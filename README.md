## Assignment - 1
Make a 3 layer NN from NLP using Pytorch and GloVe as the embedding

#### The repo file contains 3 files
1. source_code.py
2. corpous.txt
3. Readme.md 
* I have trained the neural network with the help of 20000 lines from the corpous and then I have have vadidated and tested using 10000 lines.
* Run the source_code.py with the command ```python3 source_code.py``` in the terminal.
* The output you see is the training model's losses as the paramters get updated by using the optimisers.
* A text-file named 2020102046-LM1-perplexity.txt will get the output perlexity scores and gets updated in every epoch.
* You can change the hyper - parameters to better the training phase of the NLP.
* The source code outputs the neural network in terms of the modal weights and the perplexity score text file.
